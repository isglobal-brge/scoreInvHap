Description: scoreInvHap can get the samples' inversion status of known inversions. scoreInvHap uses SNP data as
 input and requires the following information about the inversion: genotype frequencies in the different
 haplotypes, R2 between the region SNPs and inversion status and heterozygote genotypes in the
 reference. The package include this data for 21 inversions.
